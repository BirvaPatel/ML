### Assignemnt-1:
Given the time requirements (in minutes) for doctors to attend patients at ER at the hospital.  Write the Gurobi script to model the problem in part 1 and 2 

•	In problem-1, Formulated an optimal assignment of Patient 1 and Patient 2 to Doctor 4 and Doctor 5 in such a way that each doctor receives a different patient and the total hours spent by the doctors is minimized.</br>
•	In problem-2, Formulated an optimal assignment of six patients to six doctors such that each doctor receives a different patient and the total time expended by the ER is minimized. 

### Assignment-2:

Apply deep learning techniques to train  Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models using the training data and then, in the test phase, predict the optimized time required using the trained model. Finally predict the performance (ANN and CNN) using appropriate performance metrics.

### Assignment-3:

Contains dataset of 1500 CT scans of various parts of the body such as abdomen, chest and head. Trained machine learning models in order to classify the provided images. Used CNN architecture from scratch to extract features  from an intermediate dense layer and then,
•	Task-1, Apply the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm to the extracted features from CNN and find the optimal value of K. The value of K can be considered as [3, 5, 7, 9]. Determine the performance of the model using an appropriate performance metric. </br>
•	Task-2, Apply Random Forest (RF) algorithm to the extracted features from CNN. Tune at least two hyperparameters using random search. Determine the model's optimal performance, the confusion matrix, and the value of hyperparameters producing the optimal performance. 

### Comparison of CUDA and Python performance:

•	Write a cuda code to multipy the metrix of different dimention. 
Where A(matrix-1) range from 1 to n and B(matrix-2) is static and for second case, A and B both range from 1 to n.

•	write a Python code of this task, and then compare the running time between the your CUDA code and your Python/MATLABbased code 


### I-ELM for Classification and regression dataset:

Implement IEM algorithm in python on One classification dataset(CIFAR-10) and One regression dataset(AirQuality(From UCI)).

### LMS using halfmoon data:


Implemented the Least-Mean-Square algorithm to deepen the understanding of the single layer network. I used the halfmoon data and mdified the dataset by total 7000 points and 3500 per moon. 

### Matrix multiplication using CUDA:

Write a cuda code to multipy the metrix of different dimention. 
A 1* B = C1 ,
A 2* B = C2 ,
. ,
. ,
An * B = Cn.
Where A range from 1 to n and B is static.


### Pretrained Alexnet with SCENE-15 and Caltech101 dataset:

Implemented the pretrained Alexnet model and simple Alexnet model with the data from scene-15 and Caltech-101 and took the average accuracy from 3 runs (test and training)
compared the performance gap and training time between the above two conditions. 


### Single Perceptron using halfmoon data:

Implemented a simple perceptron model to train the half moon data. This is  a simple demonstration to show how neuron works internally.
